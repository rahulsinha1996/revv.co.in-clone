# Revv Cars (clone) ðŸš—

**Revv Cars** is an Indian car-rental startup that offers multiple options to meet all your self-drive needs. The company was founded in 2015 and currently operates in 11 cities in India namely: Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Mumbai, Pune, Delhi NCR, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Vizag, Mysore, and Coimbatore.

In this project I have tried to make a look alike clone of **Revv Cars**. With our efforts and the technology stack, that I have learned so far in the masai school, we were able to clone the front end with high precision and quality.
